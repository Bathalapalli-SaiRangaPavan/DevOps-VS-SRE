# Branches and Pull Requests Guidelines

## One Story, One Branch, One PR
For each user story or task, create one dedicated branch and associate it with one pull request (PR). This keeps our work organized and traceable.

## Continuous Updates in a Single PR
When working on a story, make all necessary updates within the same branch and PR. Keep updating the existing PR until it receives approval, rather than creating multiple PRs for the same task.

## Avoid Declining PRs Due to Mistakes
If you make an error in a PR, please refrain from declining it. Instead, make the required corrections within the same PR. This approach maintains the commit history and makes it easier to track changes.

## Meaningful Commit Messages
When committing changes, provide meaningful and descriptive commit messages. Clear and informative commit messages enhance code understanding and collaboration among the team.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can streamline our development process, maintain code quality, and facilitate effective teamwork.
