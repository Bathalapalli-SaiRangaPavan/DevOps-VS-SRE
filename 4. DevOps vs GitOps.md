# DevOps vs GitOps
DevOps and GitOps are both approaches to software development and deployment that aim to improve collaboration, automation, and efficiency. 

## Scenario: Building and Deploying an E-commerce Website

### DevOps
#### DevOps Focus:
- DevOps is a culture and set of practices that emphasize collaboration and communication between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
- It aims to streamline the software delivery process and improve the deployment pipeline.

#### Workflow:
- Development: Developers write code for new features or bug fixes.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Code is regularly integrated into a shared repository, and automated tests are run.
- Continuous Deployment (CD): If the tests pass, the code is automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
- Release: After successful testing in the staging environment, the code is released to production.

#### Automation:
DevOps relies on automation tools for building, testing, and deployment. 

### GitOps:
#### GitOps Focus:
- GitOps extends the principles of DevOps by using Git as a single source of truth for both infrastructure and application code.
- It introduces the concept of declarative infrastructure, where the desired state of the system is defined and managed in Git.

#### Workflow:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure is defined in code (e.g., using tools like Terraform) and stored in a Git repository.
- Application Code: Application code is also stored in the same Git repository.
- Git Repository as Single Source of Truth: Any changes to the infrastructure or application are made through Git commits.
- Continuous Deployment with GitOps Tooling: A GitOps tool (e.g., Flux, ArgoCD) continuously monitors the Git repository and automatically deploys changes to the target environment based on the desired state defined in Git.

#### Automation:
- GitOps automates the deployment process based on changes in the Git repository.
- The entire system is reconciled to the desired state stored in Git.

## Comparison:
- ```DevOps```: Focuses on collaboration between development and operations teams, with automation throughout the software delivery lifecycle.
- ```GitOps```: Extends DevOps by using Git as the central source of truth for both infrastructure and application code, emphasizing declarative infrastructure and continuous deployment from the Git repository.
