# SRE vs DevOps: A Comprehensive Comparison

## 1. Installation and Setup:
### SRE:
- Installs and sets up EKS cluster from scratch using tools like Terraform.
- Responsible for infrastructure management, including deploying EC2 servers, security upgrades, and creating Golden AMI.
### DevOps:
- Installs applications on an existing EKS cluster set up by SRE.
- Focuses on application management, upgrading versions, and patching vulnerabilities.

## 2. Ingress Setup:
### SRE:
- Sets up Ingress controller, a one-time activity for routing traffic to the outside world.
### DevOps:
- Sets up Ingress objects, adding/updating rules for external access.

## 3. Argo CD Setup and Usage:
### SRE:
- Sets up Argo CD from scratch, installing and making it ready.
### DevOps:
- Deploys application charts using Argo CD, managing application deployments.

## 4. Version Upgrades:
### SRE:
- Upgrades EKS and Argo CD versions.
- Handles infrastructure version upgrades.
### DevOps:
- Upgrades application charts to be compatible with the latest EKS and Argo CD versions.
- Manages application version upgrades.

## 5. Backup and Recovery:
### SRE:
- Sets up Kubernetes backup and recovers the Kubernetes cluster from failures.
### DevOps:
- Informs which applications require backup and recovers application failures after the cluster is back to operational.

## 6. Stability and High Availability:
### SRE:
- Ensures platform stability and high availability of the infrastructure.
### DevOps:
- Ensures application delivery and high availability of the applications.

## 7. Infrastructure and Application Management:
### SRE:
- Manages infrastructure, including setting up networks, disaster recovery, and handling infrastructure high availability.
### DevOps:
- Manages application resources, including application scalability, disaster recovery, and handling application high availability.

## 8. Cost Optimization:
### SRE:
- Optimizes infrastructure costs by managing cluster maintenance, server running costs, and component expenses.
### DevOps:
- Optimizes application resource costs.

## 9. Observability and Monitoring:
### SRE:
- Sets up monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana for infrastructure observability.
### DevOps:
- Integrates applications into monitoring tools, ensuring application observability.

## 10. Automation:
### SRE:
- Automates infrastructure tasks, treating servers and networks as code.
### DevOps:
- Emphasizes automation for both development and operations tasks.

## 11. Error Budgets:
### SRE:
- Introduces error budgets, setting limits on acceptable system failures for fast development within safe limits.
### DevOps:
- Focuses on quick feedback loops for identifying and fixing problems early.

## 12. Networking:
### SRE:
- Manages infrastructure network setup, configuring VPCs, subnets, peering, VPNs, and transit gateways.
### DevOps:
- Manages application network setup, ensuring connectivity between different applications and clusters.

## 13. Scalability:
### SRE:
- Sets up infrastructure scalability, including auto-scaling and handling increased loads.
### DevOps:
- Manages application scalability, creating pods in response to increased loads.

## 14. Version Upgrades:
### SRE:
- Handles infrastructure version upgrades, including EKS, Argo CD, and Jenkins.
### DevOps:
- Manages application version upgrades, including Java.

## Summary:
- While SRE focuses on infrastructure setup, stability, and high availability, DevOps extends its reach to application management, cost optimization, and observability. 
- Both collaborate closely, with SRE practices aligning as a specialized part of the broader DevOps framework.
- Together, they create a robust and dependable software delivery and operations ecosystem.
