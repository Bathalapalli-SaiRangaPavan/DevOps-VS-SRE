# Reliability Assurance Framework for Public-Facing Services

In Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) - SLA, SLO, and SLI are key concepts that help define and measure the reliability and performance of a system.

## Scenario: "E-Commerce Reliability Assurance Framework"
Let's create a scenario based on the context of deploying a web-based e-commerce platform

### Product Deployment:
- You've developed an innovative e-commerce platform designed to handle a high volume of transactions and provide a seamless shopping experience.

### Customer Interest:
- Several businesses are interested in adopting your e-commerce solution to enhance their online presence and sales.

### Service Level Agreements (SLA):
- As the product owner or management, to instill confidence in potential customers, you propose SLAs with commitments such as 99.9% platform availability, sub-second response times, and the ability to handle concurrent transactions during peak hours.

### Penalties and Incentives:
- The SLA includes penalties for downtime exceeding agreed limits but also outlines incentives for consistently exceeding performance expectations.

### SRE Team Involvement:
- A dedicated Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team is assigned to ensure the e-commerce platform meets and exceeds the agreed-upon SLAs.

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs):
- SREs define SLIs, specific metrics (e.g., availability, error rate, request throughput, transaction success rate, response time, and database query performance.) representing the system's behavior.

### Monitoring and Observability:
- Monitoring and observability tools are implemented to track SLIs, allowing the SRE team to quickly identify and respond to any deviations from the set objectives.

### Proactive Measures:
- SREs use automated scripts, intelligent alerting, and event-driven systems to proactively address potential issues before they impact the user experience.

### Timely Notifications:
- Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders to address issues promptly and prevent SLA breaches.

### Production Support Calls:
- SRE engineers may engage in production support calls with customers, addressing concerns and ensuring the application's reliability and availability.

### Continuous Improvement:
- SREs focus on continuous improvement, refining monitoring strategies, and optimizing the system to enhance overall reliability.

In summary, SLAs set expectations, SLOs define performance goals, and SLIs are the measurable indicators. The SRE team plays a critical role in maintaining and improving system reliability, taking proactive measures to meet and exceed customer expectations.
