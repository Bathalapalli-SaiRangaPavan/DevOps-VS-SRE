# GitHub Workflow Guide

## Introduction
This guide outlines best practices for maintaining code integrity and workflow efficiency while working on Jira stories within a Git repository.

## Creating Your Own Branch
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use `git clone` to clone the repository to your local environment.

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your Jira story using `git branch`.
     Example: `git branch 11_sftp_<your team name>`

3. **Switch to Your New Branch:**
   - Use `git checkout` to switch to your newly created branch.
     Example: `git checkout 11_sftp_<your team name>`

4. **Preserve Existing Files:**
   - Ensure that your changes do not remove existing files. Additions should complement existing files.

## Best Practice PR Creation
1. **Define Your Objective:**
   - Clearly understand the objectives of your task. Document or visualize your plan using tools like paper or draw.io.

2. **Work with Clarity:**
   - Align your code changes with the defined objectives. Maintain clarity in your code implementation.

3. **Raise the PR:**
   - After completing and verifying your work, raise the PR. Ensure your PR is well-prepared and serves its intended purpose effectively.

## Additional Tips
- **Document Your Changes:**
  - Use markdown for README files and provide inline comments for code documentation.

- **Visuals or Diagrams:**
  - Consider adding visuals to illustrate the workflow, especially for branching and the PR process.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Include tips on common issues users might encounter and how to troubleshoot them.
