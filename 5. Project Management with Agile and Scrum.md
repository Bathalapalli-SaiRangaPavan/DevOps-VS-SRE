# Project Management with Agile and Scrum

## Introduction
- Agile is a dynamic project management framework that establishes standards for adaptive project execution.
- Scrum, a subset of Agile, is globally recognized for fostering effective team collaboration and achieving goals within specific time frames.

## Project Planning
- Proper documentation and processes are crucial for project success.
- Real-time projects require meticulous planning, often spanning several weeks. This planning involves breaking down tasks into manageable steps while considering dependencies.

## Process-Oriented Approach
- Real-time projects adopt a process-oriented approach to enhance efficiency. 
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a widely-used tool, employed for planning, measuring, and recording work in a structured and process-oriented manner.

## Manager's Perspective
- Managers take a holistic view of project goals over extended periods.
- They break down goals into quarterly EPICs (3-month goals) and involve engineers in EPIC-level discussions.

## Sprint Planning
- Projects are divided into 2-week sprint cycles.
- Sprint planning meetings are crucial in identifying tasks (Jira stories) for the upcoming sprint.

## Jira Story Points
- Story points are used to estimate task complexity.
- A point value indicates task difficulty, with higher points representing greater complexity.
- Engineers provide justifications for assigned points during sprint planning.

## Responsibility and Accountability
- Engineers are responsible for completing tasks within the sprint's timeframe.
- Effective communication of blockers and challenges is emphasized during daily stand-up meetings.

## Daily Stand-up Meetings
- Daily meetings ensure team alignment.
- Engineers report on their progress, plans for the day, and any encountered blockers.

## Retrospective Meetings
- Held after each sprint, retrospective meetings evaluate completed work and provide a platform for discussing improvements.

## Incident Handling
- Incidents, such as server issues, are treated separately from planned tasks.
- [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management) is the designated tool for incident handling.

## Mind Mapping
- Managers often utilize mind-mapping techniques to plan projects and create Jira stories based on collaborative discussions.
